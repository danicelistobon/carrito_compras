# [Carrito de compras](https://danicelistobon.github.io/carrito_compras/)

This project puts into practice the concepts learned in the basics of JavaScript and some concepts of local storage
- The user can create, delete, or check the courses he wants to purchase in the shopping cart
- Courses are stored in local storage
- The cart will load the information stored in local storage in case the user visits the site again
- When a course is removed from the cart it is also removed from local storage
##### Project developed in the course [JavaScript Moderno Guia Definitiva](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-moderno-guia-definitiva-construye-10-proyectos/) at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
